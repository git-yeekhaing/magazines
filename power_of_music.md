`Nietzsche` once said that life without music would be a mistake. Do you agree with him? Is music essential for human beings? Did you know that listening to music is one of the few activities that involves using the whole brain?

Throughout numerous studies, researchers have found out that music can help dealing with stress related to heart diseases and it can improve verbal IQ. In this sense, it enhances cognitive skills. People who suffer from memory problems or brain injuries can also benefit from music, as it has been proven that listening to certain pieces may bring back old memories. A part from being relaxing, slow music -classical or celtic, for instance- reduces blood pressure. Therefore, people with high blood pressure can lower it if they listen -at least 30 minutes per day- this kind of music.

The cathartic effect of music is well-known in all cultures, meaning it offers positive results on mood and pain management, reducing the feeling of anxiety or suffering. Technically, during music time, our body releases endorphines to fight pain. In fact, some researches show that listening to music can lower depression rates by up to 25%. It seems that somehow, music gives people a sense of control.

Another particularity about music is that people tend to associate it with certain colors. For example, a study developed in Mexico and the United States in 2013 showed that people connected dark colours to sad melodies, while more cheerful colours were linked to happier pieces of music. Thus, this means music evokes colors in our minds.

Learning a new language -in your case, English- is easier if we sing the phrases when we practice at home, rather than just reading them. It apparently helps with pronunciation and aids remembering relevant information.

One curious fact is that listening to only 15 seconds of music per day can change the way we perceive other people’s faces: that is, if we listen to joyful music, we’ll be more likely to think that the other person is happy, and the opposite thing happens with melancholic music, even if people have a neutral facial expression.

In 1911, an American researcher, Leonard Ayres found out that music can also help exercise, as he observed that cyclists who listened to music pedaled faster than those who didn’t, and allowed them to exercise longer, they used their energy more efficiently. The scientific explanation for this is that music covers up fatigue, so our brain is less aware of tiredness because it’s more focused on music.

Music has undeniably been something intrinsic to manhood since ancient times. As you’ve seen, in the last decades, scientists have discovered a bunch of benefits that music provides us with; there is, though, still a long way to go in this field, to see exactly how the brain responds to music and the impact it has.
